Operating Systems Lab 2022 
Assignment Set 1 :  
Submission Deadline 18th Aug 2022 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Objectives: to learn the following: 
- Race condition 
- ps, kill, cat, chmod ls, pwd, etc. commands 
- fork() system call 
- speedup processing creating multiple processes using fork() 
A1) Write a code such that it takes input n and then the parent process (p) creates n number  of child processes (c1, c2, c3,…..cn) all of them as its direct descendent i.e. p is the parent of  c1, c2, c3 …. and also cn. Each process including the parent should display the pid & ppid once  in the terminal and also store the values in a common file (log.txt). The parent can create the  file log.txt and all its child processes can get access it.  
============================================ 
A2) Write a code such that it takes input n and then the parent process p creates a child c1,  then c1 creates c2, c2 creates c3… and so on till cn. Each process including the parent should  display the pid & ppid once in the terminal and also store the values in a common file (log.txt).  The parent can create the file log.txt and all its child processes can get access it.  
============================================ 
A3) Write a suitable code to speedup finding all prime numbers in a given range [1, N],  creating M child processes by the parent process.  
First try to run it for two processes then generalize it for M child processes =========================================== 
A4) Learn the use of ps, kill, cat, chmod ls, pwd, etc. commands 
========================================== 
A5) Execute the balance update code discussed in the class and have a feel of race condition
